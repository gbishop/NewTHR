# NewTHR

This is an experiment to see if I can rewrite
[Tar Heel Reader](http://tarheelreader.org) as a universal React app using
fluxible.

I started with the fluxible template.

My goal is a [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) that is accessible, multi-lingual, and compatible with old browsers and works even with with javascript disabled.
